THE INFLUENCE OF DEPRIVATION DOMAINS ON HEALTH DISPARITIES: AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS ON BIRMINGHAM
The datasets used in this report were sourced from the Consumer Data Research Centre(CDRC). They include datasets of the English Index of Multiple deprivation(IMD) for 2004, 2007, 2010, 2015 and 2019. The IMD datasets measure domains of deprivation in a nation at small area levels. In the datasets used in this report, the statistical unit employed in providing the indices of relative deprivation in England is the Lower layer super Output Areas(LSOAs). LSOAs are designed to have constant population statistics. This is why LSOAs in rural areas tend to be much larger than those in urban areas (Lloyd et al., 2023).
There were 32844 LSOAs in England, as at 2019, however the IMD datasets prior to 2015 have 32482 LSOAs. This is because the boundaries were reviewed to create new LSOAs. The IMD profiles deprivation by scores, deciles and ranks. The scores are derived using 33 indicators for the domains, and ranks are allocated to each LSOA in the country where the most deprived neighbourhood is given the rank 1 and the least deprived, a rank of 32844. From 2015, England is divided into ten deciles based on the rankings, where decile 1 represents the most deprived 10 percent and decile 10 represents the least deprived 10 percent in the country. The Index of Multiple deprivation data comprises 7 separate domains which in combination, make up the overall Index of Multiple deprivation using the weights given in parentheses. These domains are the variables used in the analyses and they include:
 1. Income Deprivation (22.5%)
2. Employment Deprivation (22.5%)
3. Health Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)
4. Education, skills and training Deprivation (13.5%)
5. Barriers to housing and services (9.3%)
6. Crime (9.3%)
7. Living environment deprivation (9.3%)
   
This study places primary focus on Health deprivation and disability. This domain is measured using four indicators to understand morbidity, risk of premature mortality, the effect of poor mental and physical health, and disability (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019).
The geographies utilised in conducting spatial analysis in this analyses were also included in a .shp file provided with the datasets. The datasets can be found on the Consumer Data Research Centre website here: Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) | CDRC Data

Birmingham is the study area in this project. It was selected due to its heterogeneous population, industrial history and metropolitan city status. Birmingham has 639 LSOAs with a mean IMD score of 37.61 with a minimum score of 3.431 and a maximum score of 78.083. This suggests that there is a lot of variation in domain scores across Birmingham.
Analyses
The presentation includes descriptives of the data population for 2019 as presented in the English IMD2019, as well as the descriptives for the Birmingham population. Descriptive statistics for each domain of deprivation was also included in the analyses.
The analysis also compared Health related deprivation in Birmingham in 2015 and 2019 using spatial analysis.
